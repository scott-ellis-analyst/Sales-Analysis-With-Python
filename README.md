# Sales Analysis with Python
## Overview: 
### Series of Jupyter notebooks using Python to perform the entire data analysis process on Instacart sales data.
## Project Objectives:
### Use Python wrangle, clean, merge, derive, analyze, and visualize raw data to answer the following questions:
### - WHat are busiest times?
### - When do customers spend the most money?
### - How can products be grouped to help with marketing efforts?
### - Which departments are the most popular?
### - Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
### - How are customers distributed based on their loyalty?
### - How can customers be grouped in terms of demographics and behavior?
### - What differences exists in ordering habits between customer profiles?
## Python Skills Demonstrated:
### - Exploratory analysis
### - Data wrangling and subsetting:
#### Managing data types
#### Accessing values with data dictionary
#### Creating new dataframes
### - Checking data consistency
#### Fixing mixed-type variables
#### Finding and dealing with missing values
#### Finding and removing duplicates
### - Combining and exporting data
#### Merging dataframes
#### Analyzing results from merge flag frequencies
#### Exporting merged data in pickle format
### - Deriving new variables
#### Creating columns using conditional logic
### - Grouping and aggregating
#### Creating flags 
#### Creating summary columns of descriptive statistics
### - Visualizing data
#### Creating histograms, bar charts, line charts, and scatterplots
### - Customer segmentation
#### Creating customer profiles based on demographics and behavior
